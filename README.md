# Developer setup, build, and run steps


## Setup

1. Check out this package from version control.
1. Launch Intellij IDEA, choose **Import Project**,  select the root of this package and import it as maven project. 
1. To build from the command line, set `JAVA_HOME` to point to a JDK >=11 before running `mvn`.


## Build

This package is organized into subprojects, most of which contribute JARs to the top-level plugin in the security subproject. All subprojects in this package use the Maven build system. [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/guides/index.html) comes with excellent documentation that should be your first stop when trying to figure out how to operate or modify the build.

### Building from the command line
This project has a dependency on [security-parent] project.You will have to build that project first via maven (`mvn clean install`) before attempting to build this package.

To try out the build, issue the following at the command line:

1.` mvn compile`

This will run Maven, telling it to execute the compile goal. When itâ€™s finished, you should find the compiled .class files in the target/classes directory.

The `package` goal will compile your Java code, run any tests, and finish by packaging the code up in a JAR file within the target directory.

2. `mvn package`

The `test` goal runs all the unit tests in the package

3. `mvn test`

## Debugging

Please refer to the well documented instructions provided by popular IDEs like Intellij and Eclipse on how to setup a debugger to debug code/test failures with Maven.
